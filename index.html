                                <p>Palau has become the first country to update its immigration policy and landing procedures to implement such legislation, aimed at preserving its vibrant culture and the beauty of its natural environment for future generations. It also hopes that other countries will follow suit to protect the planet for children worldwide.</p>
                                <p><span>When tourists arrive, they will be asked to sign the Pledge to protect our environment for our children.</span></p>
                                <p><span>Palau has created a world-first conservation pledge, stamped in passports for visitors to sign a declaration to protect its environment and culture for the next generation. This compulsory promise is made directly to the children of Palau, to preserve this country, their home. On December 7, 2017, Palau became the first country to update its immigration policy and landing procedures to implement legislation with the goal of preserving Palau’s vibrant culture and the beauty of natural environment for future generations. Based on the Palauan tradition of BUL* and written with the help of Palau’s children, the Palau Pledge will be stamped and signed in the passports of every visitor.</span></p>
                                <p><span>The pioneering project draws attention to the ecological challenges related to tourism, with the future of the Palauan children in mind. It further seeks to change the damaging impact of human activity on the local ecosystem, especially as the number of visitors to the island continues to rise. Palau has a long history of world-firsts in conservation. It was the first country to create a shark sanctuary in its national waters, the first to ban the destructive practice of bottom trawling, and in 2015, Palau’s leadership created the Palau National Marine Sanctuary: the largest fully-protected, no-take zone in the world. And all of Palau hopes that other countries will follow suit to protect this planet for the children worldwide.</span></p>

It consists of three atolls: Velasco Reef, Ngaruangel Atoll, and Kayangel Atoll, of which only Kayangel Island in Kayangel Atoll is inhabited. The rest of the islands are uninhabited and inhabited by algae.</p>

                                <p>Fruit is not abundant in Palau. It is the only farm built by handing down fruit cultivation methods in Taiwan 20 years ago, and these days it has become a tourist course. A variety of fruits were grown on the farm here, and all the fruits were covered with bags and netted, making it feel like you were in an orchard in Korea. In particular, dragon fruit, which is said to look like a dragon, is popular with people and is expensive. Fruits grown here do not have high sugar content like fruits in Korea, but they are protein, so they have a simple taste that you will not get tired of eating a lot.</p>

It also holds the title of having the least number of inhabitants among the capitals of countries in the world. Sometimes Melekeok Province, where Ngerulmud is located, is sometimes introduced as the capital of Palau.

                                <p>As the name of the largest bridge in Palau, the exact name is Koror-Babeldaob Bridge, abbreviated as K-B Bridge. It is a bridge that connects Korod Island and the main island, Babeldaob, and important communication facilities, water and electricity are supplied to Korol through this bridge. It was first completed in 1977 by a Korean construction company, but the bridge was cut in 1996 due to poor construction. At this time, the residents of Korol suffered great inconvenience without water and electricity for about three months, but the bridge was completed again in 2002 with the help of Japan.</p>

                                    In the case of the Blue Corner, there is a particularly strong current, so it is a place to enjoy current diving.
                                    It's because of the geography.
                                    Different currents flow from the three places, so you can usually encounter strong currents in places where you would hang a bird hook.
                                    Plankton rises from the bottom, and everything from small fish to sharks,
                                    You can meet a variety of fish.</p>
